face detection is finding a face in imagery or videos.
facial recognition is identifying that face.

face-recognition workings:
- load_image_file()
- convert loaded image from BGR to RGB, because face-recognition library understands RGB
- find faces in the image plus their encodings
- face_loc = face_locations()[0] # for testing, we only use an image with one face
- face_enc = face_encodings()[0] # for testing, we only use an image with one face
- compare faces (their encodings technically)
- results = compare_faces()
- facedistances = face_distance()
- while sentdex uses the first 'true' match, murtaza uses the lowest face distance for best match

cv2 workings:
- imread() # read images
- VideoCapture() # read videos
- imshow()
- waitKey()

ignored folders:
driver - chrome driver executable
images - directory for downloads
known-faces - different folders of known people
pics - also unknown-faces
unknown-faces - multiple images to be run against the model
videos - videos to be run against the model
